## current projects
- VieCPro & ViecoElites -> projects around the viennese courts
- SiCProD -> prosopography of the court of Sigismund (Innsbruck)
- Jelinek -> bibliographic catalogue of Elfriede Jelineks work
- Frischmuth -> similar but different author ;)
- Tibschol -> scholarly exchange of tibetan scholars
- Nomansland -> similar but different area ;)
- InTaVia -> not APIS, but uses API to retrieve/convert data

+++

## current developments
- major refactoring of APIS to work along the triple pattern
- major changes in the development workflow:
    - git flow
    - pre-commit hooks and GitHub actions for linting and automatic code formatting
- move to cluster2
- automatic deployment of review apps
- automatic tests in CI
- improved documentation 

+++

## challenges
- refactoring cost more resources than anticipated
- documentation still not at an acceptable level
- missing tests
- hard to keep an overview
- long discussions in the jfx
- quarrels between staff members

+++

## vision
- prosopographical data & semantic web group rather than the 'APIS' group:
    - use tools developed in InTaVia to finally get the Omnipot up and running
    - establish prefect (or another solution) as ETL in the institute
    - experiment with available triplestores and conversion tools to use the most powerful (while affordable) solution
